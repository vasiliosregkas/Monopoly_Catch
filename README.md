# Monopoly_Catch
This is a catching game made for Problem set 0 of the Harvardx cs50 course on edx; you control the monopoly man sprite with the left and right arrow keys trying to catch the dollar icons while avoiding the tax and police icons as they each remove 1 point or one life respectively If you lose three lives its game over.
